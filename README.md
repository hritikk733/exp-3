Image smoothing is a technique used in image processing to reduce noise or detail in an image. It typically involves blurring the image to make it appear smoother or less sharp. Common smoothing techniques include:

Gaussian Blur: Applies a weighted average of pixels in a neighborhood, with closer pixels contributing more heavily.
Box Blur (Mean Filter): A simple method that replaces each pixel value with the average value of its neighboring pixels.
Median Filtering: Replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighbors, useful for removing "salt and pepper" noise.
Bilateral Filter: Preserves edges while smoothing out areas with similar colors
